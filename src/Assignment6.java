*   PROGRAM NAME:
*       Assignment6 - ////
*
*   Description:
*	Understand the Classes and Problem
*	
*	We wish to move our Card classes from the realm of console apps to 
*	that of GUI apps.  We'll do this in stages.
*	
*	>   Read and display Card pictures - Read .gif image files as Icons, 
*	and attach them to JLabels that we can display on a JFrame.
*	
*	>   Encapsulate the Card Icons in a class GUICard - Once we debug 
*	imagery for cards, above, we can move it into its own class, GUICard.
*	
*	>   Create a CardTable class - This JFrame class will embody the 
*	JPanels and Layout(s) needed for our application. This is where all 
*	the cards and controls will be placed. 
*	
*	>   Use a CardGameFramework class - Use an already created class to 
*	deal cards for display from an actual deck.
*	
*	>Create the game "High-Card"
*	
*	The first phase (item 1) will allow you to debug the problem of reading 
*	the .gif files and displaying them on a JFrame without any excess logic 
*	or class complexity.  The second phase (items 2 and 3) will let you 
*	turn what you did in the first phase into a multi-class project.  The 
*	final phase (items 4 and 5) will add the CardGameFramework class so 
*	that your card tools can be combined with your GUI tools to create a 
*	GUI program that has real computational power for a GUI card game, 
*	"High Card".
